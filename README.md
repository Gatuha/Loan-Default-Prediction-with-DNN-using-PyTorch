# Loan-Default-Prediction-with-DNN-using-PyTorch
Description:
This analysis focuses on predicting loan defaults using a deep neural network (DNN) model built with PyTorch. The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values, scaling numeric features, and encoding categorical variables. Data visualizations explore the distribution of key features like age, loan amount, and credit score.

The dataset is split into training and test sets, and SMOTE is used to address class imbalance. A DNN model with multiple layers, batch normalization, dropout regularization, and binary cross-entropy loss is trained for binary classification. The model is evaluated using a confusion matrix, and the training process is monitored by tracking the loss curve over epochs. Finally, the modelâ€™s performance is assessed by predicting loan defaults and visualizing the results with a confusion matrix.

This end-to-end pipeline leverages the power of deep learning for loan default prediction and includes essential steps such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using PyTorch.
